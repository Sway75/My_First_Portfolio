<h1>About</h1>

<p>Computer Science is a scam.
Yes, I said what I said.
Let's be real — many of the people building real tech products today didn't learn everything in a classroom. And in many Nigerian universities (especially private ones), the practice is missing. We award Computer Science degrees, yet some institutions struggle to maintain their own portals. These are small things, but they say a lot.</p>

<p>
Yesterday, a lecturer (not this picture, just one I took before) said something that hit me hard: “You cannot succeed in this field by the classroom alone. You have to find real-world projects, real problems, and real implementations.”
And that hit hard.
</p>

<h2>COntinue Reading</h2>

<p>
We're living in an era where it's no longer about what you know, but what you can do.

I recently spoke with a senior Java developer — a first-class graduate and overall best student. Despite his academic excellence, he struggled to get a well-paying role because he lacked real-world experience. He spent two extra years after service learning and building with Java before landing his first solid job.

That conversation was a revelation.

<h3>Now the main idea</h3>

<p>
Now I'm not saying you shouldn't get a degree — or even a first class. Degrees matter. They open doors. They give you an edge. But then they must be backed by proof: projects, collaboration, problem-solving, and impact. Someone without a degree who can build real solutions will always outperform a degree holder who can’t.
That's the future
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, growth doesn't happen alone. It happens when we collaborate, share skills, and turn concepts into reality. If you have a project, an idea, or even a small initiative that needs building, let's connect—I'd love to work with people who are passionate about creating, learning, and pushing boundaries.

Till we meet again.
